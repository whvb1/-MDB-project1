# -MDB-project1
This app is the first mini project for the mdb android training program within there is a text file and a bunch of images. The app takes four random names and uses one for the picture and the "correct" name. The buttons also change color based on the answer (red or green). Exit button is a little glitchy, I'm not sure why it doesn't work completely. Also there is the framework to implement a dynamic background, however it isn't implemented yet.
*update* exit button is fully functional
